## Rales** Engine Project

### Description

Nick and Kyle's [Rales Engine](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md) project for Turing. In this project we import business data and host an API with endpoints to return records, relationships between models, and business intelligence as JSON. Checkout the schema file `schema.png` in the public directory to see the models and their relationshps.

Tech stack: Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, RSpec

** _(Um, I thought you were Ruby developers.  Don't you know how to spell 'Rails'?  Ah!  Good catch.  This project is a revamping of a previous project we competed called 'Sales Engine'.  Only this time we built it in Rails.  So it's a Rails Engine, I mean Rales Engine._

### Dependencies 

This project uses Ruby version 2.3+ with a PostgreSQL database. The dataset is from the [sales engine](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/sales_engine/tree/master/data) repository.

### Getting Started

Follow these steps in your terminal to clone the project on to your local machine and import the data.

  1. `cd` into the directory where you want the project in the terminal.
  1. Run `git clone https://github.com/ski-climb/rales_engine.git`
  1. `cd rales_engine` 
  1. `bundle` to install the gems you need
  1. `rake db:create` to create your PostgreSQL database
  1. `rake import:all` to import the data

### Test suite

Follow these steps in your terminal to run our test suite and check out the coverage.

  1. `rspec` to run the test suite
  1. `open coverage/index.html` to view the test coverage in your browser

### Hosting the site locally

  1. From within the `rales_engine` directory run `rails server` to start the server locally.
  1. In your browser visit any provided endpoint to view the response (example: `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/merchants`)
  1. Press `ctrl-c` to stop server.

### Running the Spec Harness

This project came with a spec harness. The spec harness checks the project's API endpoints by hitting urls on the local server. Follow these steps in your terminal to run the project agains the spec harness.

  1. From within the `rales_engine` directory run `rails server` to start the server locally.
  1. Open a new tab within your terminal. Be sure it is a new tab and the server is running in your first terminal tab.
  1. In your new terminal tab, run `git clone https://github.com/turingschool/rales_engine_spec_harness.git` 
  1. Run `bundle install` in the same terminal tab.
  1. In the same terminal tab, run `cd rales_engine_spec_harness`
  1. Still in the same terminal tab, run `rake` to run the spec harness tests.

### Endpoints Provided

The models are:
  * merchants
  * customers
  * items
  * invoices
  * invoice_items
  * transactions

In addition, Rails provides a way to view the existing routes (there are many in this project). To view all the available routes, use `/rails/info/routes`, e.g. `http://localhost:3000/rails/info/routes` on your local machine.

#### Single Finders

For any of the models visit :`GET /api/v1/models/find?parameters`

Parameters should that can be passed in are name, id, created_at, or updated_at. You can pass in multiple parameters.

For example: `GET /api/v1/merchants/find?name=Schroeder-Jerde`

Another example: `GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/merchants/find?id=3`

#### Multi-Finders

For any of the models visit :`GET /api/v1/models/find_all?parameters`

Parameters should that can be passed in are name, id, created_at, or updated_at.

For example: `GET /api/v1/merchants/find_all?name=Cummings-Thiel`

Another example: `GET http://localhost:3000/api/v1/invoice_items/find_all?quantity=5&invoice_id=3`
